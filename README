Take a configured connection mode and a file containing a SQL query and execute
it, saving the result as a csv.

Call query2csv with no arguments for help.

## Installation:
Requires perl, Getopt::Long, Config::Tiny, DBI, and Text::CSV.
You can either download the tarball for each of these and `make install` each one manually or use the CPAN cli via `perl -MCPAN -e shell`.
Additionally, if you are connecting a postgres server, you should install the `Pg` driver via `sudo apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl`.

## Configuration:

This is a basic config file:

~$ cat ~/.query2csv
```
[modes]
local.dsn = dbi:Pg:dbname=dev
local.username = postgres
local.password = postgres

remote.dsn = dbi:Pg:dbname=dev;host=remote.host.com;port=5432;
remote.username = postgres
remote.password = postgres
```

The Perl DBI module will try to establish a connection like so:
```perl
DBI->connect($dsn, $username, $password);
```

In the example above, `dsn` is also known as data source name. This will specify the type of driver to use and parameters such as database name, hostname and port.
**NOTE:** The parameters in the `dsn` are driver specific.


## Usage:
After you've created a config file, query2csv can be used thusly:

query2csv dev ~/sql/query.sql ~/files/query.csv

If you'd like to execute your query without a cursor, you can use:
query2csv --no-cursor dev ~/sql/query.sql ~/files/query.csv
